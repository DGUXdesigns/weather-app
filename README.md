# Weather App üå§Ô∏è

This Weather App is a dynamic web application built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and external APIs. The app allows users to search for and view current weather conditions for any location worldwide. It fetches data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and sunrise/sunset times and displays them in an interactive interface.

The main purpose of this project is to showcase API integration, frontend development skills, and dynamic UI updates based on real-time data.

## Features üöÄ

- **Search for Weather by Location**: Users can input a city or country to get current weather information.
- **Day/Night Icon**: Automatically switches between day and night icons based on the current time in the location.
- **Display Current Conditions**: Shows temperature, humidity, wind speed, and visibility.

- **Weather Highlights**: Includes additional information like visibility, UV index, and more.

## Purpose üéØ

The goal of this project is to demonstrate proficiency in frontend development by:

- Fetching and displaying weather data using external APIs.
- Handling user input and integrating it into a live application.
- Display dynamic weather information for the current day and the following seven days.
